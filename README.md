provided no enemy;  
alice can send unencrypted plaintext message to bob  
but eve could be around.  
that is why encrypt the message and send it to mike  

alice and bob can have a common key.  
with a caesar cipher and a key; they can transmit data which has no meaning to eve  
now eve doesnt understand alice and bob, he tries to decrypt the jibberish message.
